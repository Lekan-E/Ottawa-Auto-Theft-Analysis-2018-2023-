# Ottawa Auto Theft Analysis
## Project Background
Car theft rates in Ottawa have seen a steady increase over the 5-year period, rising by 124.4% from 2018 to 2023. This analysis covers year-on-year changes, high theft neighbourhoods, recovery rates and the most stolen vehicle manufacturers.

## Executive Summary
In Ottawa, an average of four vehicles are stolen every day. After the historically high auto theft trends in 2022, the data in this report illustrates the National Auto Theft Crisis. Auto theft data represents vehicle styles such as (cars, SUVs, trucks, motorcycles, vans, trailers, ATVs, snowmobiles and motor homes). In 2023, the Ottawa Police Service reported over 1,994 stolen vehicles, amounting to approximately $26.6 million in loss value, with a recovery rate of 57%. Barrhaven and Orleans neighbourhoods remain hotspots for auto thefts across the city, with the highest number of auto thefts and the lowest recovery rates*.

The top three priorities to make a meaningful impact on the auto theft crisis in Ottawa are:
- Preventing vehicles from being stolen in the first place through effective anti-theft measures by manufacturers; and
- Placing a strong emphasis on information sharing and data-driven partnerships.

By understanding why auto theft trends are happening, organizations and decision-makers dedicated to preventing auto theft can effectively collaborate to create solutions. This report aims to provide key stakeholders with the information and insights to support a collective and collaborative approach to ending auto theft in Ottawa.


## TEMPORAL ANALYSIS
Auto theft in Ottawa has shown fluctuating trends over the years, with a slight decline in 2023 following a record-high year in 2022. Despite this, theft rates have surged dramatically since 2018, emphasizing the need for targeted prevention strategies based on peak times and daily patterns.

- Following a historically high year in 2022 with 2,033 recorded thefts, auto theft in Ottawa experienced a slight year-over-year (YoY) decrease of (-2.1%) in 2023. However, overall trends show a significant increase of (123.8%) in thefts between 2018–2023.
- Thefts showed a continuous upward trend throughout the year, with rates peaking in October and November at about 5 thefts per day. While there was a noticeable dip in monthly rates at the start of the year, the data does not indicate strong seasonality.
- Weekends accounted for (26.3%) of thefts, suggesting that thefts are more likely to occur on weekdays, possibly due to less vigilance during regular work or commute times.
- Over (58%) of thefts occur in the evenings and nighttime hours (8 PM - 3 AM), with a significant (40%) during the evenings. This further highlights the significance of implementing additional home surveillance features during these high-risk periods to deter thefts.


## GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
High-risk neighbourhoods and residential areas, particularly in the East and West, have emerged as hotspots, highlighting distinct geographical patterns in theft activity.

- Auto theft across Ottawa from 2018–2023 has increased significantly, as follows: 
    - (205.7%) increase in the West, 
    - (139.2%) increase in the East and 
    - (30.9%) increase in Central Ottawa.
- East Ottawa consistently reported the highest number of thefts, accounting for over (41%) of thefts during this period. This trend is likely influenced by its proximity to the Port of Montreal, a key export hub for stolen vehicles.
- The neighbourhoods of Barrhaven, Orleans and Centretown were the highest-risk areas, with a total combined loss of approximately ($17.7 million).
- High theft density correlates with residential areas, particularly in densely populated neighbourhoods in the West and East, compared to Central Ottawa, where we have more commercial activities.

## VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES
- Toyota vehicles accounted for (21.8%) of auto thefts, with the (2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 Highlander SUV Models) being the most targeted vehicle. This trend is primarily attributed to its demand in the international markets and the weaker security features of these models.
- Majority of vehicle thefts (52.9%) in Ottawa were vehicles made in 2017 or newer ($76.7 million loss value) primarily because organized crime rings are focusing their efforts on stealing new/luxury vehicles for maximum profit in overseas sales.
- This is further illustrated by the recovery rate of (50.9%), suggesting that many are being exported overseas through the Ports, likely for resale.
- Automobiles (sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks) were the most stolen vehicle types, accounting for (58.7%) of thefts.
- Other frequently stolen brands include Honda, Ford, Jeep, and Lexus, collectively representing a loss value of $36.6 million.

## RECOVERY RATES
Between 2018 and 2023, there were 7,826 recorded vehicle thefts in Ottawa, with only (57.2%) of vehicles being recovered. Recovery trends have declined over time, dropping from (63.9%) in 2018 to (55.7%) in 2023, despite a (2.9%) year-over-year increase from 2022.

- Hyundai vehicles had the highest recovery rates (83.1%) among cars with at least 200 reported thefts. This high recovery rate likely indicates a lower demand for Hyundai models on the black market, with an average value of approximately $3,131. This is further evidence that these cars were primarily stolen to commit other crimes rather than for resale.
- Lexus vehicles, in contrast, had the lowest recovery rate (40.2%) among cars with at least 200 reported thefts, with only 179 recovered cars from 483 stolen vehicles. The average value of these stolen vehicles was approximately $13,170, suggesting that most were exported overseas by organized criminal groups.
- Vehicles manufactured in 2017 or newer had a significantly lower recovery rate (51.4%) compared to those manufactured before 2017 (71.9%), for models with at least 100 reported thefts.
- The disparity in recovery rates could stem from a variety of factors, including theft techniques, resale demand, and tracking capabilities. Toyota and Lexus, despite being popular targets, have notably lower recovery rates, underscoring the need for enhanced security measures for these brands.


## Solutions and Recommendations
- Enhanced Security for High-Rosk Areas: Increase police and security presence in high-risk neighbourhoods, particularly in the East, during peak theft periods at night (8 PM-3 AM).
- Improved Vehicle Anti-Theft and Tracking Features: Collaborate with automakers, particularly Toyota, Honda, Ford, Jeep and Lexus, to improve anti-theft systems, address vulnerabilities that criminal groups exploit, and enhance car tracking systems to improve recovery rates.
- Community Awareness and Information Sharing: Placing a strong emphasis on information sharing and data-driven partnerships amongst communities. Launching awareness campaigns targeting residents in high-risk neighbourhoods about theft prevention measures, such as smart surveillance systems.
